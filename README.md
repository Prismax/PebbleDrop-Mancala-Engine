# PebbleDrop-Mancala-Engine
PebbleDrop is a Matlab mancala engine, equipped with Monte Carlo Tree Search end Minimax algorithms to evaluate positions and choose moves at the best of the chosen settings and available computational power.

% This is a Game Engine for the popular board game       |
% known as Mancala, formally called Wari. The user is    |
% able to chose the playing algorithm independently      |
% for both player from the command line once the script  |
% is runned. Line 25->30 contain parameters for the      |
% engine. Lowering these numbers makes the move choice   |
% faster but also determines worse moves.                |
% To make the game more informative while also avoiding  |
% excessive wait times, the engine proceds to give a     |
% rough evaluation of every position.                    |
